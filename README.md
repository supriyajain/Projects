Projects
=========

Document classification using class sensitive PageRank algorithm
Implemented class sensitive PageRank algorithm. Documents are represented as nodes in a graph and edge between 2 nodes shows content similarity. Category with highest final PageRank is picked up as document’s label.

Multi-threading - Token Bucket Emulation in C
Emulated a traffic shaper which transmits packets controlled by a token bucket filter using multi-threading within a single process.

Basic Search Engine Implementation
Implemented basic building blocks of a search engine such as crawler, inverted index and page rank algorithm in python during ‘Building a search Engine’ course at Udacity.com.
